    /*  Task 1 :   Create a method called calcFeetAndInchesToCentimeters . It needs to have two parameters.
			   Feet is the first parameter, inches is the second parameter.

				- You should validate that the first parameter feet is >=0, and second parameter inches is >=0 and <=12.
					 Return -1 from the method if either of the above is not true.

				- If the parameters are valid, then calculate how many centimeters comprise the feet and inches passed to this
				 		  method and return that value.

				- Create a second method of the same name but with only one parameter inches is the parameter and validate it
						  >=0, return -1 if it is not true. But if it is valid, then calculate how many feet are in the inches.

				- Call the other overloaded method passing the correct feet and inches calculated so that it can calculate
								correctly.

				- Hints : Use double for your number datatypes 1 inch = 2.54cm and 1 ft =12 inches
